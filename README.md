# JavaGotchi

## Object-Oriented Athletes!

My proposed project for this term is a simple application based off of the Japanese handheld game *Tamagotchi*, with a
bit of a sports themed twist. For some context, *Tamagotchi* is a small handheld device that 'houses' a digital pet,
who needs to be regularly fed, cleaned, played with, and looked after by the user in order to remain happy. Since their
release in 1996, *Tamagotchi* pets have captured the hearts of about 91 million people across the world, and remain a fond
memory in the minds of many children born in the late 90's and early 2000's.

I hope to replicate the magic of the original *Tamagotchi* through my Java desktop application, *JavaGotchi*. This
application will function very similarly to the original *Tamagotchi*, except it is free and avaliable online for all to enjoy,
and has a bit of a twist! In *JavaGotchi*, you will recruit pets to be players on your growing *GotchiBall* team! Your job
as the coach of your pets is to train them to be the best version of themselves they can be, so that they can win their
next game. You can recruit a new pet after each game you win, allowing your team to grow as **arbitrarily** big as you want! You can name
each new recruit, making each one of them unique! It is important to note that
the focus of *JavaGotchi* is not in the actual games themselves, but in training and collecting more pets (you are the coach,
not a player after all). I settled on a sports theme because I thought it would be a fresh new take on *Tamagotchi* (which
has existed in many iterations at this point), and would fit well with a basic gameplay loop that allowed you to collect
an arbitrary number of pets.

*JavaGotchi* is not for any one demographic, anyone can enjoy training their pets! That being said, it is a simple
and fun game designed to appeal to children and youth more than anyone else. I hope to make the design intuitive so that
anybody can pick it up and understand how to play, as to cater towards a younger audience. Anybody looking for
a way to pass their time, or a fun activity to cheer them up, will find that *JavaGotchi* is the perfect fit.

I decided upon this idea for my project since I have always been a fan of video games growing up (it was one of the main
reasons I initially started my career in computer science), and wanted to take this project as an opportunity to get my
hands dirty developing a simple game of my own. I knew I didn't want to scope to be too big, since I am still fairly new
to Java, so I drew inspiration from one of the simplest games I know, *Tamagotchi*. Obviously this game will not be
on the level of the *Nintendo* classics that got me into gaming as a kid, but hopefully it will serve as a creative and
unique game development project that can fill out my portfolio, and improve my chances at landing a job as a game developer
sometime in the future.
