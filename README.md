## Demo!

Check out my demo of *JavaGotchi* [here](https://youtu.be/zi0zbNK49-Q?si=C36J2vd3q2pC1Qj8)!

## Object-Oriented Athletes!

*JavaGotchi* is a simple application based off of the Japanese handheld game *Tamagotchi*, with a
bit of a sports themed twist. For some context, *Tamagotchi* is a small handheld device that 'houses' a digital pet,
who needs to be regularly fed, cleaned, played with, and looked after by the user in order to remain happy. Since their
release in 1996, *Tamagotchi* pets have captured the hearts of about 91 million people across the world, and remain a fond
memory in the minds of many children born in the late 90's and early 2000's.

I aimed to replicate the magic of the original *Tamagotchi* through my Java desktop application, *JavaGotchi*. This
application functions very similarly to the original *Tamagotchi*, except it is free and avaliable online for all to enjoy,
and has a bit of a twist! In *JavaGotchi*, you recruit pets to be players on your growing *GotchiBall* team! Your job
as the coach of your pets is to train them to be the best version of themselves they can be, so that they can win their
next game. You can recruit a new pet after each game you win, allowing your team to grow as arbitrarily large as you want! You can name
each new recruit, making each one of them unique! It is important to note that
the focus of *JavaGotchi* is not in the actual games themselves, but in training and collecting more pets (you are the coach,
not a player after all). 

*JavaGotchi* is not for any one demographic, anyone can enjoy training their pets! That being said, it is a simple
and fun game designed to appeal to children and youth more than anyone else. I hope to make the design intuitive so that
anybody can pick it up and understand how to play, as to cater towards a younger audience. Anybody looking for
a way to pass their time, or a fun activity to cheer them up, will find that *JavaGotchi* is the perfect fit.
